<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>I enjoy playing video games, hanging out with friends and working with computers. One of my favorite projects I have worked on computer wise is the White Castle Computer, a computer inside of a White Castle Crave Case. I used some old computer parts from a friend and threw it all in a crave case and ta-da, a master piece was created.</p>
